            <h2><b style="font-size: 40px;">Introduction</b></h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein was a renowned theoretical physicist who is best known for his theory of relativity. Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, Einstein revolutionized our understanding of the universe with his groundbreaking work in physics.
                His equation, E=mc^2, is one of the most famous equations in science and is synonymous with mass-energy equivalence. Einstein's immense contributions to science and humanity earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</p>

            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>Einstein showed an early interest in science and mathematics. He excelled in academics, and at the age of 16, he moved to Switzerland to attend the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich. After graduation, he struggled to find a suitable job
                in academia but eventually secured a position as a patent examiner in Bern, Switzerland. During this time, he continued to develop his theories on physics and published several groundbreaking papers.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Relativity</h2>
            <p>In 1905, Einstein published his theory of special relativity, which laid the foundation for modern physics. The theory introduced the concept of space-time and the idea that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform
                motion. In 1915, he published his theory of general relativity, which described the force of gravity as a curvature of space-time caused by mass. General relativity revolutionized our understanding of gravity and its effects on the
                cosmos.</p>

            <h2>Nobel Prize and Later Years</h2>
            <p>Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which demonstrated the particle-like behavior of light and laid the groundwork for quantum theory. Despite his scientific achievements,
                Einstein remained politically and socially active throughout his life. He advocated for civil rights, pacifism, and disarmament.</p>
                <p>As a vocal critic of nationalism and militarism, Einstein became an advocate for peace and worked towards the abolition
                    of nuclear weapons. In 1933, he emigrated to the United States to escape the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany. There,
                    he accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he continued his research
                    and theoretical work.</p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein's contributions to science and humanity continue to inspire generations of scientists, researchers, and thinkers. His work has shaped the foundations of modern physics and has far-reaching implications for our understanding
                of the universe. Einstein's profound insights and intellectual curiosity have left an enduring legacy that will continue to influence scientific inquiry for years to come.</p>
                <p>Not only was Einstein a brilliant scientist, but he also possessed a deep sense of empathy and concern for the world. His
                    thoughts on peace, education, and human values have become guiding principles for many people seeking a better and more
                    compassionate world. Einstein's intellectual and humanitarian legacy serves as a reminder that scientific progress
                    must be accompanied by moral responsibility and a commitment to the well-being of all humanity.</p>
